    <string name="neck_warning">When looking at a smartphone, if you use it while holding it down, it puts a lot of strain on your neck. Every time the neck is pushed forward by 1 cm, the load applied increases by 2 to 3 kg, which is a big burden and can cause turtle neck syndrome. Even if the turtle neck lasts, it can interfere with the blood and oxygen supply to the head, resulting in poor concentration or headaches. So, tuck your chin in and keep your ears and shoulders in line to ease the strain on your neck.</string>
    <string name="eye_warning">If you look at your smartphone for a long time, your eyes get very tired. If you look at your smartphone for a long time, you blink less, which causes dry eye syndrome and presbyopia in your 20s and 30s. Using a smartphone in the dark can cause glaucoma, so you should avoid it even more. So, blink frequently and look into the distance while using to reduce eye fatigue.</string>
